                Curious about technology since my childhood, I chose to become a general engineer in order to better understand the workings of our modern world. Along the way, I discovered an interest in project management and a real passion for the Web which lead me to finish my schooling with a Web Dev bootcamp in order to become a Full Stack Developer.
